        <time>1961</time> ETS ABDUCT A FIR TREE. One night in 1961, Valborg Agren and her friend Tilda were outside the town of Hallviken, Sweden when they noticed a strange light in the field just off the road. Stopping to investigate, they were amazed to see three short figures holding devices that sent red sparks up the trunk of a fir tree. After watching for several minutes, it slowly dawned on them that these figures were not human.

		Just before 8pm on Sep 15, 1962, 
		three boys were shocked to see a UFO drop from the sky, plunge into the Oradell 
		Reservoir in New Jersey, and takeoff. Unknown to them, others saw the object. 
		The next night, the UFO was back. Soon, UFOs were being seen nightly, by hundreds 
		of people. The UFO wave would garner national headlines.

		Three sailors in two boats were in the Mediterranean Sea and saw what they thought was a foreign submarine. Then, nearly a dozen figures in weird wetsuits emerged and climbed onto the “sub.” Moments later it rose from the sea to reveal itself to be a flying saucer. </time> .
