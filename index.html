          two carpenters, Stig Ekberg and Harry Sjöberg</a>, 
        are returning from Stockholm, Sweden, to their cabin on Väddö island, about 20 
          miles to the northeast. About 6 miles north of Älmstä the engine of their Ford V8 
          pickup begins to sputter and fail, and the headlights go out. They see a huge, 
          shining object descending toward them and making a turn above Väddö Bay to the left 
          of the road. It lands in the middle of the road about 300 feet in front of their car.

<!--        The object illuminates the surrounding landscape with such a tremendous amount of light 
          that a nearby barn is clearly visible. The air smells of ozone and smoldering insulation. 
          They estimate it is 53 feet long and 20 feet high, with a bright glow underneath the 
          object and a dazzling mist surrounding it.
        They watch the object for about 10 minutes, then the object gets brighter, lifts 
          off the ground, moves to the left and up, makes a sudden turn, and speeds away in the 
          direction it had come. Afterward, the air is stifling and hot, but the engine starts 
          up right away. A few minutes later they return to the landing site and find flattened 
          grass and a still-hot, smooth, triangular piece of metal the size of a matchbox, which 
         they retrieve.
        They submit the metal to several labs over the next few years, apparently 
          without ambiguous results, but in the process it is split into three pieces. Finally, an 
          engineer in Linköping named Schalin finds the metal has the hardness of sapphire and a 
          specific weight of 15.2. It can take several thousand degrees C. heat without getting 
          red hot. One of the pieces is submitted to the US Air Force and not returned. In the 
          early 1970s, another piece is examined by James Harder at the University of California, 
          Berkeley, who establishes it is composed of tungsten carbide, cobalt, and traces of 
          titanium, and that it has been manufactured.

        The Shag Harbour UFO Incident</a>
        Shag Harbour UFO is Canada’s equivalent of the Roswell UFO in the United States. On 
        October 4, 1967, an unknown object crashed into the water near the tiny fishing village 
        of Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia. At least 11 people watched the object as it headed towards 
        the harbor. Multiple witnesses heard a whistling sound and a loud bang as it crashed into 
        the water. Shortly afterwards, Laurie Wickens and four of his friends contacted the Royal 
        Canadian Mounted Police after they spotted a large object floating in the Atlantic Ocean 
        about a 1,000 feet from shore.<br>

        The RCMP, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force became involved in an 
        unsuccessful recovery effort. The investigation revealed that all commercial, private and 
        military aircraft along the eastern seaboard were accounted for. The Navy combed the 
        seafloor of the Gulf of Maine, but found no trace of the object.
