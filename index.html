        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Glacier_(AGB-4)">USS Glacier</a>, watches a 
        tear-shaped fireball over Admiralty Bay, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, in slow,

        in two as if exploding. It disappears after 10 seconds. (UFOEv, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006091691&view=1up&seq=65&skin=2021">

		  The Lake Movil UFO Incident</a>
          After the entire family had a UFO sighting, Mildred Anderson and her daughter Marilyn 
          notice an odd glowing red object outside their cabin. Looking outside, they are amazed 
          to see a large window on a craft, and inside are two ETs staring right at them.

		Swimming ET's-The UFO Investigator</a>
        Three sailors in two boats were in the Mediterranean Sea and saw what they thought was a foreign submarine. Then, nearly a dozen figures in weird wetsuits emerged and climbed onto the “sub.” Moments later it rose from the sea to reveal itself to be a flying saucer.

		Ordeal at Oradell</a>
        Just before 8pm on Sep 15, 1962, three boys were shocked to see a UFO drop from the sky, 
        plunge into the Oradell Reservoir in New Jersey, and takeoff. Unknown to them, others 
        saw the object. The next night, the UFO was back. Soon, UFOs were being seen nightly, 
        by hundreds of people. The UFO wave would garner national headlines.

		The Shag Harbour UFO Incident</a>
        The Shag Harbour UFO is Canada’s equivalent of the Roswell UFO in the United States. On 
		October 4, 1967, an unknown object crashed into the water near the tiny fishing village 
		of Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia. At least 11 people watched the object as it headed towards 
		the harbor. Multiple witnesses heard a whistling sound and a loud bang as it crashed into 
		the water. Shortly afterwards, Laurie Wickens and four of his friends contacted the Royal 
		Canadian Mounted Police after they spotted a large object floating in the Atlantic Ocean 
		about a 1,000 feet from shore.

        The RCMP, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force became involved in an 
		unsuccessful recovery effort. The investigation revealed that all commercial, private and 
		military aircraft along the eastern seaboard were accounted for. The Navy combed the 
		seafloor of the Gulf of Maine, but found no trace of the object.
